**Build Android and iOS applications using TensorFlow Lite and Core ML**

## What is this book about?
Machine learning is a technique that focuses on developing computer programs that can be modified when exposed to new data. We can make use of it for our mobile applications and this book will show you how to do so.


This book covers the following exciting features:
* Demystify the machine learning landscape on mobile
* Age and gender detection using TensorFlow Lite and Core ML
* Use ML Kit for Firebase for in-text detection, face detection, and barcode scanning
* Create a digit classifier using adversarial learning
* Build a cross-platform application with face filters using OpenCV
